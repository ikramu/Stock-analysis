How would I describe myself
---------------------------
Personally, I am social and easy-going and I like to meet people from different backgrounds. Professionally, I would describe myself as hardworking, innovative and someone which enjoys learning about emerging tools and techniques. I am focused and give attention to the details and I always like to deliver a bit more than I am supposed to, both in terms of quality and quantity.

Five positives
--------------
1. Social 
2. Humble (will be one with the least ego)
3. Hardworking
4. Enjoys reading and learning about new technologies 
5. Innovative


Three negatives (Well some of them depends on the context so may be positives in some sense and negative in another)
---------------
1. I believe in keeping business and pleasure apart. So at my office desk, I speak code and methods; while in the lunch room, I speak movies and sports.
2. I am quite specific about my food choices
3. My speaking speed is a more than average (perhaps tied to my thinking process) which I need to take care of.

Things to ask about BCG
-----------------------
1. How long are the assignments usually?
2. How much travelling is usually needed?
3. If someone wants to learn about new technologies, how is usually the training program
