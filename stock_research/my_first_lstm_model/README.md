# Stock price prediction using LSTM
This mini-project contains the code for predicting stock prices using LSTM. The code expects minute-level data and can be customized to predict next $n$ values. Keep in mind that the model performance is considerably poor for larger $n$. I have used it on $n$ between 1 and 5.

## Usage

First install the required libraries as follows.
`pip install -r requirements.txt `
