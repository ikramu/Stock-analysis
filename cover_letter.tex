Dear Sir/Madam, \\

\noindent
I am Computer Science graduate at KTH, defending my thesis in October 2014. My area of expertise lies mainly in machine learning and high performance computing. I am well-versed in processing and mining big-data using machine learning techniques, and I have demonstrated it both in research (mining terabytes of DNA data) and in industry (mining gigabytes of financial data for forecasting stock trends).

\noindent
I am social, outgoing, and love to collaborate in a multi-disciplinary teams. I believe that great ideas are created and developed by team-effort.

\noindent
I am specially interested to work at <> not only because this is exactly what I have been doing until now both in industry and in research capacity, but also because its my passion to squeeze mounds of data to extract interesting facts. Having being part of the team that designed and implemented data mining systems which are actively used by Fortune 500 companies, I think I can capitalize on my previous industry and consulting experience to be part of <> family in big success stories.

\noindent
I am very optimistic about listening from you, and to explain how I may be a good addition to <> team. I may be reached anytime via email \url{ikramu@kth.se} or via phone +46-73-9366175. \\

\noindent
Best regards, 

\noindent
Ikram Ullah
